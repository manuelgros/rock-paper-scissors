The Odin Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors - Game

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors Game. Created with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The game is played against the computer.

The first version will be played exclusively in the console, so there will be no GUI or webpage content.
I will add these elements at a later point in my education


UPDATE V 1.1

I added some graphical content to the website and changed the mode to play to prompt inputs and alert messages. The game can now be played in the browser window instead of console.
I also added a button to start the game.
